## :project: **Project: Data Cleaning for Bank Marketing Campaign**

This project involves cleaning and reformatting data collected from a bank marketing campaign aimed at targeting customers for personal loans. The cleaned data will be prepared for import into a PostgreSQL database and will be used for future marketing campaigns.

> **Note**: This is part of a **Datacamp Data Engineering project**.

### :question: **Problem Overview**

Personal loans are a major revenue stream for banks. For example, in September 2022 alone, UK consumers borrowed around **¬£1.5 billion** ([source](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-12/Household%20Finance%20Review%202022%20Q3-%20Final.pdf)), generating an estimated **¬£300 million in interest** over two years. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is around **10%** ([source](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/)).

The goal of this project is to clean and structure the data collected by the bank during a marketing campaign aimed at encouraging customers to take out personal loans. The cleaned data will be used to set up a PostgreSQL database that will allow easy import of future campaign data.

The goal of this project is to:
1. Clean the raw data from `bank_marketing.csv`.

3. Split the cleaned data into three separate CSV files:
   - `client.csv`: Data related to the client.
   - `campaign.csv`: Data related to campaign outreach and outcomes.
   - `economics.csv`: Economic indicators used during the campaign.
